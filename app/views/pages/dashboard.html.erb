<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
This is a beta for a puzzle game similar to Candy Crush or Bejeweled but instead of pay-to-play for in-game features, you can use your knowledge (currently Chinese, but other languages and categories like math are planned) as payment.  The more you play, the more Chinese content you can unlock (only seven characters are available right now).  Additional features such as graphics and sound, more weapon types, different enemies, and a leveling/game progression to increase your damage are not yet included. </p>

<p><b>Helpful Hints</b>
<ul>
  <li>Getting questions right gives you more time.  Don't worry about being fast starting out</li>
  <li>The more you get right, the more knowledge you get and the stronger you become</li>
  <li>Strokes are important in Chinese!  Make sure to draw each line separately based on the pictures below the game board</li>
  <li>If you don't know something, relax.  All the answers are in a scrollable bar at the bottom of the game</li>
  <li>Refresh the page to start over again</li>
  <li>After playing, check your <a href="/attempts/"><b>stats</b></a> using the dropdown navigation menu</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Good luck and enjoy.</p>
